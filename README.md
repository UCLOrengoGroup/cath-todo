# CATH: TODO

This project exists to allow anyone to create and keep track of issues relating to the [CATH protein structure classification](http://cathdb.info), including:

 * CATH data
 * CATH web pages 
 * CATH API

We encourage anyone to add your own issues: whether that's a query where something is unclear, a wishlist for a feature you would like to see or any problems/bugs with the current pages. 

**Note: please check that your issue doesn't already exist before creating**

## About CATH

http://cathdb.info

[CATH](http://cathdb.info) is a [bioinformatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics) resource that groups the 3D structures of [protein domains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain) into superfamilies (a collection of domains that are related by evolution). It uses this body of work (built over 20 years) to predict the location of these structural domains on over 50 million known protein sequences (in a sister resource: [Gene3D](http://gene3d.biochem.ucl.ac.uk)). These data - alongside known information about protein function and functional sites - help us to understand and recognise patterns that occur during evolution. These patterns can be used to further our understanding of the mechanisms of evolution and to predict structure and function of previously unannotated protein sequences.
