# CATH Web

This project exists to allow anyone to create and keep track of issues relating to the CATH protein structure classification web pages (and API).

http://www.cathdb.info

We encourage anyone to add your own issues: whether that's a wishlist for features you would like to see on the pages or problems/bugs with the current pages. 

(It would be great if you could check that your issue doesn't already exist before creating a new one)
