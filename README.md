# CATH: TODO

This project exists to allow our external users (that's you) to create and keep track of issues relating to the [CATH protein structure classification](http://cathdb.info), including:

 * CATH data
 * CATH web pages 
 * CATH API

We encourage anyone and everyone to add issues - no matter how trivial or complex they may seem. This might be a query because some part of the documentation is unclear, a wishlist for a feature you would like to see, or a problems/bug encountered on the web pages (hopefully not). Either way: all feedback is very welcome.

We cannot guarantee a timeline in which feature requests will be implemented, however the level of community interest in any particular issue will definitely be taken into account as we prioritise our work.

**Notes:**

* please check whether a similar issue already exists before creating a new one
* if a similar issue does exist, please add ```+1``` to let us know you consider this important

## About CATH

http://cathdb.info

[CATH](http://cathdb.info) is a [bioinformatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics) resource that groups the 3D structures of [protein domains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_domain) into superfamilies (a collection of domains that are related by evolution). It uses this body of work (built over 20 years) to predict the location of these structural domains on over 50 million known protein sequences (in a sister resource: [Gene3D](http://gene3d.biochem.ucl.ac.uk)). These data - alongside known information about protein function and functional sites - help us to understand and recognise patterns that occur during evolution. These patterns can be used to further our understanding of the mechanisms of evolution and to predict structure and function of previously unannotated protein sequences.

## FAQ

### I have an issue, but I'm new to GitHub - what do I do?

 * sign up to get a GitHub account (it's free and useful)
 * click the ["Issues"](https://github.com/UCLOrengoGroup/cath-todo/issues) tab
 * scan through the existing issues to check this issue doesn't already exist
 * click the ["New Issue"](https://github.com/UCLOrengoGroup/cath-todo/issues/new) button
 * provide as much detail as you can
